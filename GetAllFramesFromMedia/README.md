## How It Works
This shortcut takes any valid media (*i.e. live photos, videos*) from your Photos library, splits the media into every single frame using *ffmpeg*, and saves each frame as a JPEG in your Files app.

You can also select multiple media at a time!

## Demo
- We will be using the [Walt Disney Mickey Mouse Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgD6i44ctDs) as an example for the demo.

## Getting Started
1. Install [a-Shell mini](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell-mini/id1543537943).
2. Download this shortcut and run through the setup.
3. Open the **a-Shell mini** app, type `pickFolder`, and press enter.
4. Select the *frames folder* that you choose/created during *Step 2*, and press **Open**.
	- *Steps 3 & 4* tell **a-Shell mini** the location of your frames folder, and bookmarks it for future runs.
5. At this point, you can go back to the **Shortcuts** app to run the shortcut.


## Conclusion
Once you have done all instructions in [Getting Started](#getting-started), you have successfully setup the **Get All Frames From Media** shortcut on your phone. Now, you will be able to get every single frame from your media any time you want.

If you're only looking to grab a few frames and have specific scenes in mind, I recommend checking out [Frame Grabber](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frame-grabber/id1434703541) (*not sponsored*), instead. However, if you are looking for that extra bit of precision in frames or need a process a good chunk of frames at a time, my shortcut does the job for that. üëç

Feel free to leave any [issues](https://github.com/MrJeevs/Shortcuts/issues/new/choose) if you happen to run into unexpected errors, looking for improvements, or even let me know how it's working for you! More than happy to hear any type of feedback!


## Auto-Updater
This shortcut is powered by [UpdateKit API](https://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit-api/v1). UpdateKit API is not another standalone shortcut updater, rather one that is integrated in the shortcut itself. This means there is no need to install another shortcut to check for updates! The updates come to you!

Whenever a new update is released, the next time you run the shortcut, it will prompt you to either **Install** or **Skip** the update. If you choose to **Skip** the update, the shortcut will still run as intended.


## Privacy
- *This shortcut does not scrape for any sensitive or identifying information or install any sort of malware on your phone* ‚úÖ. *As always, I recommend my users to double-check every action this shortcut performs, as it is your responsibility to be 100% sure of what you are using*.
- *If the shortcut asks you permission to run, just click **Always Allow**. It will ask this from **every source** you use the shortcut from. You can remove sources from the privacy settings of the shortcut later, should you choose to change your mind.*
- *The UpdateKit API uses your device's model and iOS version to ensure new updates are compatible with your device. If your device and/or iOS version are not compatible with the shortcut, future updates won't be presented to you.*
