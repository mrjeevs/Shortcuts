## How It Works

The **LinkedIn Profile To Apple Contact** shortcut allows you to convert any LinkedIn profile into a Apple Contact on your device, by grabbing the following contact information from LinkedIn, **if it's available to you**:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Profile Picture
- Phone Number
- Email
- Address
- Birthday
- Connection Date
- Last Company Name
- Last Company Position
- Websites
- Twitter URL
- LinkedIn URL

Here's how to use this shortcut:

1. Open `Safari`.
2. Go to [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) and login.
3. **Make sure to [`Request Desktop Site`](https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Safari-Request-Desktop-Site-iPhone-updated.jpg) on the page**, otherwise the shortcut won't work.
4. Go to your connection's LinkedIn profile page.
5. Tap on the [`Share Sheet`](https://i.imgur.com/KDyO3ny.png) icon.
6. Run the `LinkedIn Profile To Apple Contact` shortcut.
7. All contact details will pop up in *Quick Look*, as an Apple Contact. If you like what you see, go ahead and click on the `Share Sheet` icon on the bottom left.
8. Share the contact to the `Apple Contacts` app.
9. Tap `Done` on the *Quick Look* view to see the `Apple Contacts` confirmation screen.
10. Tap `Save` on the top right.

If you follow all steps correctly, your LinkedIn connection should be saved as an Apple Contact now, with all relevant details added!

## Auto-Updater

This shortcut is powered by [UpdateKit API](https://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit-api/v1). UpdateKit API is not another standalone shortcut updater but rather one that is integrated into the shortcut itself. This means installing another shortcut is unnecessary to check for updates! The updates come to you!

The Auto-Updater will only check half the time whether there is a new update. If your device is offline, the Auto-Updater will not run at all. It checks this by verifying your device's current IP address. In other words, if your device has an IP address, it means you are connected to the Internet.

Whenever a new update is received, it will prompt you to either **Install** or **Skip** the update. If you choose to **Skip** the update, the shortcut will still run as intended.


## Privacy

- *This shortcut does not scrape for any sensitive or identifying information or install any malware on your phone* âœ…. *As always, I recommend my users to double-check every action this shortcut performs, as it is your responsibility to be 100% sure of what you are using*.
- *If the shortcut asks permission to run, tap **Always Allow**. It will ask this from **every source** you use the shortcut from. You can remove sources from the privacy settings of the shortcut later, should you change your mind.*
- *The UpdateKit API uses your device's model and OS version to ensure new updates are compatible with your device. If your device or OS version is not compatible with the shortcut, future updates won't be presented to you.*
