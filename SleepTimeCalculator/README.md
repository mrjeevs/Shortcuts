## How It Works

The Sleep Time Calculator has three functions that can help you get your bedtime and wake up times just right. Here's how each of them works:

-  **I want to wake up at...**
	- If you know the time you want to wake up at, this function can recommend you what times you can go to bed.
	- Enter the time you want to wake up at, and the calculator will output **4 bedtimes**, with each different amount of hours of sleep (*ranging from 4.5 to 9 hours of sleep*).
	- You can choose one of these bedtimes to ensure you won't feel completely tired or groggy when you wake up.
- **I want to sleep at...**
	- If you know the time you want to go to bed, this function can recommended you what times you should set your alarm for. 
	- Enter the time you want to go to bed at, and the calculator will output **4 wake-up times**, with each different amount of hours of sleep (*ranging from 4.5 to 9 hours of sleep*).
	- You can choose one of these wake up times to ensure you won't feel completely tired or groggy when you wake up.
- **Sleep now!**
	- If you are going to bed right now, this function can recommended you what times you should set your alarm for. 
	- The calculator will output **6 wake-up times**, with each different amount of hours of sleep (*ranging from 1.5 to 9 hours of sleep*).
	- You can choose one of these wake up times to ensure you won’t feel completely tired or groggy when you wake up.

**NOTE:**  *The Sleep Time Calculator provides sleep and wake-up times based on different sleep cycles and durations. The recommended sleep time for an average adult is **7-9 hours**, but other times are provided for situations where you might have less time for sleep but still want to avoid feeling tired and groggy. Keep in mind that individual sleep needs can vary, so the recommendations provided by this calculator may not be optimal for everyone. If you have persistent sleep issues, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional.*

### The Science Behind The "Sleep Time  Calculator"
The Sleep Time Calculator uses scientific principles related to the sleep cycle and sleep duration to provide recommendations for optimal bedtimes and wake-up times.

The sleep cycle is divided into several stages, including light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Each of these stages is associated with different brain activity patterns, muscle tension levels, and other physiological changes. Sleep cycles typically last around 90 minutes, and a typical night's sleep consists of several cycles.

The Sleep Time Calculator takes advantage of these sleep cycle principles to recommend optimal bedtimes and wake-up times based on the user's desired bedtime or wake-up time. For example, the calculator can recommend four different bedtimes if the user wants to wake up at a specific time. Each of these bedtimes corresponds to a different sleep cycle, with the goal of waking up at the end of a cycle to feel more refreshed and alert.

Similarly, if the user wants to go to bed at a specific time, the Sleep Time Calculator can recommend four different wake-up times based on the duration of sleep cycles. This helps ensure that the user wakes up at the end of a sleep cycle and feels rested and alert.

In addition to sleep cycle principles, the Sleep Time Calculator also takes into account the recommended sleep duration for adults, which is generally 7-9 hours per night. The calculator provides alternate sleep duration options for those who have less time for sleep, but still want to avoid feeling tired and groggy.

## Conclusion
And, that's it! You can install the **Sleep Time Calculator** shortcut on your phone and use it anytime. Hopefully, it will help you catch more *Zzz's*.

Feel free to leave any [issues](https://github.com/MrJeevs/Shortcuts/issues/new/choose) if you happen to run into unexpected errors, looking for improvements, or even let me know how it's working for you! More than happy to hear any type of feedback!


## Auto-Updater
This shortcut is powered by [UpdateKit API](https://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit-api/v1). UpdateKit API is not another standalone shortcut updater, but rather one that is integrated into the shortcut itself. This means there is no need to install another shortcut to check for updates! The updates come to you!

Whenever a new update is released, the next time you run the shortcut, it will prompt you to either **Install** or **Skip** the update. If you choose to **Skip** the update, the shortcut will still run as intended.


## Privacy
- *This shortcut does not scrape for any sensitive or identifying information or install any malware on your phone* ✅. *As always, I recommend my users to double-check every action this shortcut performs, as it is your responsibility to be 100% sure of what you are using*.
- *If the shortcut asks you permission to run, just click **Always Allow**. It will ask this from **every source** you use the shortcut from. You can remove sources from the privacy settings of the shortcut later, should you change your mind.*
- *The UpdateKit API uses your device's model and iOS version to ensure new updates are compatible with your device. If your device and/or iOS version are not compatible with the shortcut, future updates won't be presented to you.*
