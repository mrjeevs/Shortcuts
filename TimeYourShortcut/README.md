## Notes
- I'd recommend running this shortcut against your tested shortcut **at least twice**. It may ask for permissions to run actions the first time, depending on your shortcut, which will add redundant time to the total run time.
- If your tested shortcut requires user interaction, be mindful that it will contribute to the total run time, depending on how long it takes the user to select/input. If you are interested in testing a "non-user" section of your shortcut, I'd recommend copying the format of this shortcut and implementing it inside your tested shortcut, to get the most accurate time results.
