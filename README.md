# Shortcuts
Welcome to my Shortcuts repo! This repo represents a comprehensive list and details of all Apple shortcuts I have developed till date.

To download my shortcuts, just click on the banner within each README file. You can also find my shortcuts published on [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/user/MrJeevs).

Feel free to leave any feedback (*questions, bugs, features*) on my shortcuts! To do so, create a *New issue* in the [Issues](https://github.com/mrjeevs/Shortcuts/issues) tab.
